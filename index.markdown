## About me 
Hi,I'm Arun Kumar! Previously worked as a Process Associate at Genpact and currently pursuing Web Development at Humber College. My goal is to transition into DevOps and related roles, where i can leverage both development and operations to build efficient and scalable systems.
I'm passionate about technology, always eager to learn, and love taking on new challenges.
Outside of tech, i enjoy playing cricket, which keeps me active and competitive.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to connect with me!
